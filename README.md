# TaskBar Search
Add a searchbar into the task bar, with custom search engines.

A portable version, compiled for Windows, can be downloaded [here](http://dev.otmax.fr/TaskBarSearch.zip).

## How to use the sources
- Import the project (.pro) into Qt 5.
- Configure the Debug and Release into a "build" folder placed at root.
- Modify, compile, whatever ...
- On windows, create a deployable version by running `deploy_release.bat`. If there is any proble, take a look at the first lines of the file.
